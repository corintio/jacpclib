# jacpclib (java annual computer poker competition library)
A library implementing the latest acpc protocol (annual computer poker competition) in java

Basically this does the following: 
* implement a simplified ANTLR grammar for the acpc competition grammar (http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/downloads/documents/protocols/protocol.pdf).
* implement a model representing the match state including all required information
* Provide a client to send and retrieve game actions to the acpc server

This is currently **work in progress!** So no guaranteed for anything to stay as it is nor work as expected!
